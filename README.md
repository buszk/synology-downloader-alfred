# Synology Downloader for Alfred

Creating download tasks in Synology has a lot of frictions. One needs to keeps a Synology page logged in and switch between tabs to start a file download.
This Alfred workflow automate that into simple commands to be invoked anytime without context switching.


## Supported shortcuts
We currently support the following commands
```
sd download <link>
sd list
sd delete <task_id>
```
